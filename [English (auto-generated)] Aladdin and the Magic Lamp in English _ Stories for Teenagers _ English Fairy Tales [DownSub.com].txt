aladdin and the wonderful lamp

once upon a time in the Arabian desert

there was a kingdom

there lived a poor tailor who had a son

named aladdin

he liked to play all day in the market

with his pet abu the monkey

[Music]

unfortunately when he was 16 his father

passed away

[Music]

mother i will work at the shop and earn

money don't worry

so aladdin started to work in his

father's shop

one day a stranger came to his shop

hello dear aladdin i heard about your

father's demise

i was not in the city at that time

i have never met you before

who are you

i am your uncle i had been living out of

this country for many years

oh

uncle

i had heard about you from my father i

came here to show you a secret place

a hidden treasure

come with me

come along

a treasure

okay let's go

aladdin sat on his camel and they left

for the journey they traveled four days

in the desert

at last they reached two mountains

divided by a narrow valley

here we are

gather some sticks to light a fire

as the fire was lit the man threw a

powder in the fire and started to chant

some magical words

the ground trembled and split away from

below the ground a flat marble stone

came up with a ring on it

huh

whoo

what's happening uncle i'm getting

scared

fear nothing just do as i say

beneath this stone lies a treasure which

is to be yours so you must do exactly as

i tell you

first you take this ring aladdin took

the ring the stone came up and below the

stone

there were steps to go down

at the end of those stairs you will find

a garden of fine fruit trees

go through them without touching

anything or you will die instantly

keep walking until you come to a place

where a lighted lamp stands

pour out the oil it contains and bring

it to me

this ring will protect you from danger

aladdin went down the stairs carefully

without touching its golden walls

below the stairs there was a garden of

fruit trees

such delicious looking fruits

aladdin was hungry he couldn't stop

himself from plucking them

as soon as he plucked an apple it turned

into a ruby

whoa

[Music]

plucked some grapes which turned into

pearls

aladdin gathered as many fruits as he

could in this way

soon he saw a lit up lamp

he removed the oil in it

and piled it on the fruits

aladdin returned to the stairs where his

magician uncle was eagerly waiting

come on hand over the lamp to me

my hands are full

come to help me uncle

you silly boy

either give me the lamp or stay here

forever

in his anger the magician muttered some

magic spells and the stone door shut

closed aladdin got locked inside the

cave

uncle

uncle

let me come out uncle uncle i shouldn't

have believed that man

aladdin cried and cried for days waiting

for someone to rescue him but no one

came

oh somebody get me out of here please

somebody help me

while saying his wish aladdin touched

his fingers on the ring and to his

surprise he reached his house

[Music]

where have you been for such a long time

i searched for you everywhere i could

aladdin told her the story and showed

her all the treasure he had collected

this lamp is so old

she rubbed the lamp to clean it to her

surprise there came out an enormous

genie

[Music]

my lady

tell me your wish i'm your slave since

you hold the lamp aladdin and his mother

were astonished

mother asked genie for a feast since

they both had been hungry for many days

immediately genie brought a dozen silver

plates to the dining table

then on each plate appeared delicious

food items like roasted meat pastries

butter rolls and much more

aladdin and his mother ate the food to

their satisfaction

[Music]

mother sold the plates in the market and

bought necessary things to live one day

aladdin was taking a walk through the

market with a boo

suddenly he heard an announcement

shut down the shops clear the road the

person whoever looks at the princess

will be headed

princess

i've never seen her

today i will see her anyhow

aladdin hid himself behind a stack of

barrels

there came princess palanquin

she was looking out through the curtains

aladdin was mesmerized by her beauty

wow

she is the most beautiful girl i have

ever seen

i will marry

her he ran to his house and told his

mother about his newfound love

how can you even think of getting

married to a princess

the sultan will get you beaten up if he

finds out

i'm ready for that

you just go to the palace and take my

proposal

take some of the jewel fruits as a gift

mother took some jewel fruits and

wrapped them in a silk cloth

she went to the court of the

sultan the sultan's guard stopped her

from entering but the sultan was curious

to see what she has brought inside the

silk cloth

let her come in

thanks a lot your majesty i beg your

daughter's hand for my son and marriage

my son has fallen in love with the

princess

it would be insulting for my daughter to

live with such a poor man as your son is

and

what have you brought inside the silk

rags

she unwrapped the cloth and showed the

peculiar fruit-shaped jewels to the

sultan

i have never seen such beautiful jewels

in my life

i'm impressed but before i accept your

proposal your son must prove himself

tell him to bring 40 golden trays of the

same gems

two slaves wearing the richest clothing

shall carry each plate

yes your majesty

mother went home and told aladdin about

sultan's conditions

don't worry aladdin rubbed the lamp and

asked genie for what the sultan demanded

jeannie presented a house full of slaves

with jewels and golden plates

take this to the sultan this time he

will be pleased aladdin's mother went to

the palace immediately and presented the

gifts

you have impressed me again

but your son must build a splendid

palace to live with my daughter

mother went home and told latin about

the sultan's condition

he immediately rubbed the lamp and said

his wish to genie

genie built a splendid palace overnight

it was visible from the sultan's window

the genie spread a carpet from aladdin's

palace to sultan's palace

well done genie

now give me royal clothes and a

beautiful horse to ride

yes master as you wish

genie dressed him in the finest robes

aladdin road to the sultan's palace on a

beautiful white horse

good to see you young man you have

proved yourself

you deserve my daughter as your wife

i announce your marriage start the

preparations

aladdin and the princess got married

happily the kingdom was filled with

happiness and joy the marriage made

aladdin famous in all the kingdoms and

countries the magician also heard of the

marriage and aladdin's sudden richness

how did this boy escape from the cave

he must have stolen my lamp to gain this

wealth

i will teach him a lesson the magician

went to aladdin's kingdom he disguised

himself as a lamp seller he went to

aladdin's palace with an exciting offer

aladdin was not in the palace at that

time

does anyone want to exchange old lamps

with the new ones

aladdin will be very happy if i

surprised him with a new lamp he's using

that old lamp for a very long time

she took the magic lamp and made a deal

with the magician

he instantly rubbed the lamp and called

out to genie

master tell me your wish

i'm your slave since you hold the lamp

take this palace along with the princess

to a far away place in the desert where

no one can find this palace

with a boom the palace disappeared

sultan saw from the window that

aladdin's palace had vanished from its

place

he commanded to bring aladdin to his

palace

because of your magic tricks i have lost

my daughter

bring her to me within four days or you

will be beheaded

i will find her i promise

aladdin wandered in the entire kingdom

for three days but couldn't find the

princess anywhere

i must take the help of the ring this

will help me again

i wish to see my princess

soon after he found himself below his

palace it was a large desert and in

between stood his only palace

he snuck inside and found princess in

her room they both hugged each other and

cried

princess told him all about the incident

don't worry i have a plan to escape and

get my lamp back

aladdin whispered into her ear and gave

her a potion bottle

it was a potion which makes the victim

unconscious

aladdin hid behind the curtain to keep a

watch the magician came to the palace

oh dear mustafa

why don't you drink the juice i have

made today please try

my queen

i was waiting for this moment since such

a long time give me the drink

even if this were poison i would drink

it

princess poured the juice in a glass and

added some drops of potion then she made

him drink the juice

doesn't everything look awfully dark in

here

the magician eyelets were closing slowly

and he numbed down on the table aladdin

came out immediately and pulled out the

lamp from his jacket master master tell

me your wish i'm your slave since you

hold this lamp take us to the sultan's

kingdom along with our palace

leave this cunning magician somewhere

deep in the desert so that he can't find

his way out again

genie did what he was told and they were

all in their home kingdom again

seeing aladdin's bravery the sultan

offered him his crown a grand coronation

ceremony was held for aladdin and they

all lived happily ever after
